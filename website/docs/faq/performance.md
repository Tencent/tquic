# Performance 

## How fast is TQUIC?

[The document](../further_readings/benchmark) includes a benchmark report of different QUIC libraries, which you can refer to for more information. 

It is important to note that the performance of the QUIC library greatly depends on the specific features being used and the environment in which it is running. Therefore, we encourage users to conduct their own benchmarks using a configuration similar to what they plan on using in production.
