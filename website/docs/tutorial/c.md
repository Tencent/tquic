This tutorial describes how to use the TQUIC C API.

:::tip
The complete example code for this article can be found in the `app/src/bin` directory of the TQUIC repository on GitHub:
* [simple_server.c](https://git.woa.com/tquic/tquic/blob/master/apps/src/bin/simple_server.c)
::: 

The TQUIC C API is functionally equivalent to the TQUIC RUST API, except programming language details.

* To begin working with the TQUIC C API, we recommend referring to the "[Core Concepts](core_concepts.md)" section, which covers important concepts related to its usage.
* Additionally, detailed guidance on using the API can be found in the ["Using the Rust API"](rust.md) section.
