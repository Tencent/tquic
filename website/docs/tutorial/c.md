This tutorial describes how to use the TQUIC C API.

:::tip
The complete example code for this article can be found in the [TQUIC C example](https://github.com/tquic-group/tquic-example-c) repository on GitHub:
* [simple_client.c](https://github.com/tquic-group/tquic-example-c/blob/main/simple_client.c)
* [simple_server.c](https://github.com/tquic-group/tquic-example-c/blob/main/simple_server.c)
::: 

The TQUIC C API is functionally equivalent to the TQUIC RUST API, except programming language details.

* To begin working with the TQUIC C API, we recommend referring to the "[Core Concepts](core_concepts.md)" section, which covers important concepts related to its usage.
* Additionally, detailed guidance on using the API can be found in the ["Using the Rust API"](rust.md) section.
